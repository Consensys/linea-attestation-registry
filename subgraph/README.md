# Verax - Subgraph

This subgraph aims to index the data generated by the smart contracts of Verax.

## How to use it?

Our subgraph is deployable on all the networks where Verax is deployed.  
You can replace `XXX` by the name of the networks you want to work on in the commands below:

- `arbitrum-goerli`
- `arbitrum-mainnet`
- `arbitrum-nova`
- `arbitrum-sepolia`
- `linea-goerli`
- `linea-mainnet`

### 1. Add secrets

1. Copy the .env.example file to a .env file
2. Fill `DEPLOY_ENDPOINT_XXX` with the endpoint(s) dedicated to network(s) you want to work on
3. Fill `IPFS_ENDPOINT` with your IPFS endpoint (you can get one for free via Infura)
4. Fill `IPFS_IDENTIFIERS` with your IPFS identifiers (you can get them for free via Infura)
5. Fill `SUBGRAPH_NAME_XXX` with the name you want to give to the subgraph

Note: You need to encode your identifier and secret key to Base64, following this format: `IDENTIFIER:SECRET`.

### 2. Create the subgraph

```bash
pnpm run create:XXX
```

### 3. Build the subgraph

```bash
pnpm run build:XXX
```

### 4. Deploy the subgraph

```bash
pnpm run deploy:XXX
```
